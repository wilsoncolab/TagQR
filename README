TagQR button provides a visitor to your site with a trackable QR code that can be printed and used anywhere.  Currently, this is achieved via the Bit.ly and Google Charts API's.  

This project is aimed at spreading awareness and use of QR codes, by making them more accessible by establishing patterns and providing resources.

TagQR is a Wilson CoLab.


The script for the button button is based on John Resig's Easy Retweet Button
